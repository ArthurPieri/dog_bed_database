To implement a self-balancing binary tree in Python, you can use the AVL (Adelson-Velskii and Landis) tree algorithm. Here's a step-by-step guide to implementing it:

1. Define a Node class with attributes for the data, left child, right child, and height of the node. The height of a node represents the maximum number of edges in the longest path from the node to a leaf.

2. Create a BinarySearchTree class that will handle the operations of the self-balancing binary tree. It should include methods like `insert`, `delete`, `search`, and others.

3. Implement the core logic for the insertion operation. When inserting a new node, determine its position in the tree based on its value. If the value already exists, you can choose to ignore it or update the node's data.

4. To maintain the balance, calculate the height of each node in the tree and update it accordingly. Use the height of the left and right child nodes to calculate the balance factor of each node. The balance factor is the difference between the heights of the left and right subtrees.

5. Perform necessary rotations to balance the tree if the balance factor becomes greater than 1 or less than -1. These rotations include left rotation, right rotation, left-right rotation, and right-left rotation.

6. After performing rotations, update the heights of the affected nodes.

7. Repeat steps 3-6 for the delete operation, ensuring that the tree remains balanced after removing a node.

8. Test your implementation by inserting, deleting, and searching for nodes in the self-balancing binary tree.

Remember to handle edge cases such as an empty tree, handling duplicates, and updating the root node when rotations occur.

Here's a basic implementation to get you started:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
        self.height = 1

class AVLTree:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = None

    def insert(self, data):
        # Implement insertion logic here

    def delete(self, data):
        # Implement deletion logic here

    def search(self, data):
        # Implement search logic here

    def _insert_recursive(self, root, data):
        # Implement recursive insertion logic here

    def _delete_recursive(self, root, data):
        # Implement recursive deletion logic here

    def _search_recursive(self, root, data):
        # Implement recursive search logic here

    def _update_height(self, node):
        # Implement logic to update node heights here

    def _balance_factor(self, node):
        # Implement logic to calculate the balance factor here

    def _perform_rotation(self, node):
        # Implement rotation logic here

    def _left_rotation(self, node):
        # Implement left rotation logic here

    def _right_rotation(self, node):
        # Implement right rotation logic here

    def _left_right_rotation(self, node):
        # Implement left-right rotation logic here

    def _right_left_rotation(self, node):
        # Implement right-left rotation logic here

```

Keep in mind that this is a basic implementation, and you may need to modify or expand it based on your specific requirements.
